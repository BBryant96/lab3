## The contributions

### David

 530       Staffordshire South

![David's graph of West Midlands constituencies](DavidF-plot.svg)

This plot shows, for all constituencies in the West Midlands region, the relationship between electoral change (between Conservative and Labour parties, at the 2015 and 2017 General Elections) and the percentage of people aged 18-24 according to the 2011 census.

Perhaps surprisingly, gains for Labour (over the Conservatives) appear to have been largest in those West Midlands seats where there were fewest young people resident according to the census.

The majority of West Midlands constituencies show some gain for Labour over Conservative.  The *Staffordshire South* constituency, highlighted in red in the plot, appears to be fairly typical as far as these two variables are concerned.

**The above is just an illustrative example of the sort of graph and text you might include in this file.  I fully expect that some of the graphs you'll produce will be more interesting than this one!**

### Nayia
57 Birmingham Edgbaston

![Nayia's graph (also) of West Midlands constituencies](NayiaC-plot.svg)

Same plot as Prof. Firth's above but now the *Birmingham Edgbaston* constituency is highlighted in red in the plot. 

The *Birmingham Edgbaston* constituency is similar to the majority of constituencies with regards to the Relative LabCon vote ratios between 2015 and 2017, as it shows some gain for Labour over Conservative. However, it differs from the majority of constituencies with regards to the percentage of people aged 18-24 according to the 2011 census in the West Midlands, as it is one of the 4 consituencies with the largest percentage of young people (above 15%).

![Zsigmond's graph of West Midlands constituencies](zsigmondPlot1.svg)

The plot above shows the relationship between the decrease in percent of people voting for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) between 2015 and 2017, and the estimated proportion of the population voting "Leave" at EU referendum in 2016.
Each datapoint represents a constituency of the West Midlands.

Before going into further details, following a sanity check, it can be confirmed that the minimum difference between the percent of UKIP voters by constituencies between 2015 and 2017 is a positive number, therefore it makes sense to apply that set of differences as a plot variable.

The scatterplot suggests a positive correlation between the two variables, which, knowing the party's stance on the issue of leaving the Europen Union, might seem contradictory.
After all, it implies that the constituancies with a higher proportion of people in favour of leaving the EU are happened to be the ones where the party has lost a larger proportion of their voters between 2015 and 2017.

A sensible explanation might be the party's limited presence in politics following the results of the referendum.
In this case, it's likely that the constituancies with a higher proportion of "leavers" were the ones where the party has gained a (proportionally) larger political base before 2016, hence losing respectively larger percents of their voters later.

Considering these particular variables, Wyre Forest, a West Midlands constituency, seems to be a quite normal datapoint within the set.
